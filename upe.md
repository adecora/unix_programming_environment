# THE UNIX PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT

- this is an old book but it's held in high esteem by many. Seeing how many linux commands resemble those of unix and having enjoyed the C book, co-written by Kernighan, I thought I'd skim over this one and see what it still has to offer.
- These are my notes on what I understand of the book and what I manage to read of it.
- I will use mac OS to test the scripts provided in the book and probably report if they are still relevant.

## PREFACE/TRIVIA:
- Unix was created in 1969 in Bell Labs and rewritten in C in 1973. In 1974, it was licensed to universities (the so called BSD).
- Unix is successful because of its portability, the fact that it's written in C, a high level language. 
- The **Unix philosophy** states that the relationship among different programs is what makes a great system. Even trivial programs can be combined to create great software, if they work well together.
- An important theme of the book, is how programs work together and how they are used to create other programs, and how they fit in the environment where they run.
- Use existing unix tools instead of writing programs that the same task clumsily. 

## CHAPTER 1: UNIX FOR BEGINNERS
- Unix is a time sharing operating system _kernel_. A **kernel** is program that let users run their programs, controls resources and provides a file system. Time sharing means that the the use of the CPU is rapidly switched among different users and programs that seem to be running simultaneously. 
- Unix can also refer to the kernel along with other system tools such as editors, compilers, command languages.. etc.
